</br  >
Problem Statement: Predict Human Activity and classify them into WALKING, WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING </br  >
Sequential Classification Problem </br  >
Dataset: Human Activity Recognition </br  >
7352 observations with 128 datapoints taken within 2.56 seconds with 50% carry forwarded in the training dataset. Each datapoint has 9 measurements for:</br  >
•	Body Acceleration X axis </br  >
•	Body Acceleration Y axis </br  >
•	Body Acceleration Z axis </br  >
•	Body Gyroscope X axis </br  >
•	Body Gyroscope Y axis </br  >
•	Body Gyroscope Z axis </br  >
•	Total Acceleration X axis </br  >
•	Total Acceleration Y axis </br  >
•	Total Acceleration Z axis </br  >
 </br  >
Goal </br  >
•	Implement Deep Neural Networks as previous state is important to predict the present </br  >
•	Showcase that Standard Neural Networks shouldn’t be used to predict sequential data </br  >
 </br  >
Steps Completed </br  >
•	Importing data </br  >
•	Exploratory Data Analysis </br  >
•	Implementing Standard Neural Networks </br  >
    o	Decision Tree </br  >
    o	K Nearest Neighbors </br  >
    o	SVC </br  >
    o	Gaussian Naïve Bayes </br  >
    o	Quadratic Discriminant Analysis </br  >
•	Implementing Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) </br  >
 </br  >
Next Steps: </br  >
•	Improve efficiency of RNN </br  >
